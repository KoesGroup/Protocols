## Protocol isolating microsomal fraction						29-11-2017

Buffers:     IMPORTANT: MAKE SOLUTIONS IN GREINER TUBES & CLEAN milliQ TO AVOID KERATIN CONTAMINATION

```
Extraction buffer:  pH 7.5
 330mM sucrose    - 5.648   gr/50ml
 100mM KCl        - 0.3726 gr/50ml
 1mM EDTA         - 0.0186 gr/50ml
 50mM Tris-HCl    - 0.3029 gr/50ml
```

The next chemicals should be added just before the experiment:

```
1x protease inhibitor (complete Roche#xxx)- 400uL/9.6ml extractionbuffer
phosphatase inhibitor(#xxx) 		  - 1 tablet/10ml
5.5 mM freshly made DTT (dithiotreitol)	  - 0.0077 gr/10ml
```
```
UTU buffer:    pH 8.0
 6M urea     - 18.018 gr/50ml
 2M thiourea - 7.612   gr/50ml
 TRIS-HCL to buffer?
```

Workflow:  keep working on ice!!h
-	Freeze 4 flowers in nitrogen right after collecting in the greenhouse.

-	Grind them in pre-cooled morter and put it in a 10ml douncher.

-	Add 10ml extraction buffer.

-	Make 50 strokes		 1 stroke= up & down

-	put the lysate in a centrifugal tube
spin 15 min at 9000xG, 4 degrees

-	 transfer supernatant in new centrifugal tube, do so by pipetting the supernatant directly through a mesh-cloth. Do this quick, the cloth will absorb a lot of liquid.

-	Spin the collected supernatant 75 min at 48000xG , 4 degrees

-	Discard supernatant and dissolve pellet in 100uL  UTU-buffer.
