Sowing on agar 


MS plates per 500ml: 

- 1/2xMS = 1.1 g MS macro and micro salts with Gamborg B5 vitamins (we use Duchefa cat.no. M 0231) with (1.5%) or without sucrose! 
- 4.0 g Agar (0.8%) 
- Bring to pH 5.7-5.9, autoclave 10 minutes at 110 oC. 
- Cool to 50-55 oC. 
Optional:- Add: 500μl amphotericin (stock: 2.5 mg / ml TOXIC!).  1:1000 dilution. The final concentration 2.5μg/ml should be! Too much amphotericin inhibits germination of the seeds! 
- Mix and pour in about 15-20 Petri dishes. Already autoclaved MS + agar could easily be stored and used later. Don’t add amphotericin if you want to re-use it! 
- Mark by  seed number. 
- Seal Petri dish with a sealing strip of parafilm. 
- Germinate in growth chamber of  M5. Sign in GMO book in case of GMO seeds. 


In the case of fungi growing on amphotericin the seeds are better sterilized before  with hypochlorite (bleach / glorix): 
Option: Seeds usually germinate better when stored in water in the fridge for at least 1 night after sterilization.

- Put the seeds (each seed number) in a 2ml tube. Add 1 drop of 70% ethanol to wet the seeds and ill some of the fungi.
- Add 1 ml of a 1 :10 diluted household bleach (usually 4% hypochlorite) to. 
- Let soak 10 minutes. Carefull remove the liquid with sterile pipet .
- Wash 3x with 1 ml of sterile water and shake well again in between. 
- Add some water and pour on the agar plate. 
- Remove excess of water by keeping the plate in an angle and pipet with blue tip.
- Seal with parafilm and leave in (plant cell). 
- Usually takes about 1-2 weeks to germinate seeds.
