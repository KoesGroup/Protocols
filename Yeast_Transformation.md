# Yeast transformation

 1. Grow yeast strain overnight at 30 ˚C in 5 ml YAPD or other appropriate medium
 2. Spin down 500 µl culture in an eppendorf 5 minutes at 2000rpm at room temperature
 3. Discard supernatant and wash with 1ml TE/LiAc. Spin again
 4. Discard supernatant completely(with yellow tip)
 5. Resuspend cells in: 	1-2 µg plasmid DNA (maximum 5 µl) or 
 6. In case of in vivo recombination:	100ng digested vector+400ng insert(ratio 10:1)
 7. Add 5 µl boiled (and cooled on ice) salmon sperm (carrier) DNA (10µg/µl)
 8. Mix by vortexing
 9. Add 100 µl one-step buffer, mix well
10. Incubate at 30 ˚C for 30 minutes
11. Add 10µl DMSO, vortex again and incubate at 42˚C for 15 minutes
12. Plate cells on selection media, carefully spreading, Not to vert dry.

Take note: Yeast grows very slow at 30˚C(3-5 days)

## TE/LiAc:
TE10/1(10mMTris pH8.0/1mM EDTA):1M LiAc=8:2
(so 8 vol.TE + 2 vol.LiAc1M)

## One-step buffer:
`
 - 0.2 M LiAc(from 1M stock) 
 - 40% PEG-4000(from 50% stock) 
 - Optional: 100 mM DTT(from 1M stock) 
`

Prepare: 40% glucose separately(autoclave)

## YAPD medium(per liter):
`
- 20 gram bacto-pepto
- 10gram yeast extract
- 35 mg adenine
- (for plates add 15 gram agar)
- add water to 950 ml
- adjust pH (should be ± 5.8)
- autoclave at 110 ˚C
- add 50 ml 40% glucose after autoclaving
`

## SD medium(per liter):
`
- 6,70 gram YNB
- 0,62 gram CSM or alternative drop-out powder (drop-out for your favorite selection)
- 35 mg adenine (unless you want to select for adenine)
- if neccassary add additional aminoacids from a 100x stock
- (for plates add 12 gram agar)
- add water to 950 ml or less if you have to add 100x aminoacid stocks(10ml each)
- add ±3 drops of 10M NaOH (pH should be ± 5.8)
- autoclave at 110 ˚C
- add 50 ml 40% glucose after autoclaving
`


## Amino Acid stocks: (filter sterilised)
`
- 100x Leucine: 10 gram/liter
- 100x Histidine: 2 gram/liter
- 100x (L-)Tryptophan: 2 gram/liter 
- 100x Adenine : 2 gram/liter
- 100x Uracil : 2 gram/liter

# Check colonies by PCR: 
## Boil-Freeze method

 1. Tip a yeast colony with a toothpick or yellow tip and smear some at the bottom of a PCR vial. If necessary stripe on a fresh plate to save the clone(s). 
 2. Do this for each PCR you wish to do.
 3. Add 20 µl water to each tube and cover the whole plate or strip with lids or tape.
 4. Pre-heat a PCR machine at 100°C and take liquid N2.
 5. Vortex to be sure the colonies are resuspended
 6. Start with boiling the samples for 2-3 minutes (in PCR-machine). 
 7. Freeze the whole set by keeping in the N2 until completely frozen.
 8. Put back in the PCR machine to boil for 1 minute. 
 9. Repeat this 3-5 times. End with a boiling step.
10. Vortex again and use 2µl per PCR of 25µl.
11. Perform PCR with 35 cycles.

## Good luck!
