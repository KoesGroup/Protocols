X-Gal Agarose Overlay Assay 

This assay is semiquantitative. Cells can even be recovered from underneath the overlaid agar. The method could be used for any enzyme with a colorimetric assay. 

Cells should be grown up for 1-3 days, as either patches or single colonies 

Stock solution: 
       0.5 M Potassium Phosphate Buffer, pH 7.0
                Mix 61 ml of 1 M K2HPO4 (228 g per liter H2O) and 39 ml of
                1 M KH2PO4 (136 g per liter H2O) and add H2O to a final
                volume of 200 ml; filter sterilize and store
       6% Dimethyl Formamide (DMF)
       0.1% SDS
       (I make up the stock solution in 100 ml quantities by mixing 93 ml of
        phosphate buffer, 6 ml of DMF and 1 ml of 10% SDS.  The stock solution
        will be foamy but this is no problem)

 To run the assay:

1.	Mix:
8-10 ml stock solution per plate to be assayed
5 mg/ml low-melting agarose  (I use GIBCO BRL ULTRAPURE LMP AGAROSE, from Life Technologies   Cat.# 15517-022)

2. Microwave this mixture on HIGH to bring the temperature to 60-70 oC
        (For 50 ml of solution this is approx. 1 minute)

3. Add to the warm solution:
         0.1 to 0.5 mg/ml X-Gal
         1 drop beta-mercaptoethanol (i.e., about 50 microliters per 100 ml)

4.  Using a plastic pipette, cover the surface of each plate of cells
         with 8-10 ml of the warm solution.  The DMF and SDS will permeabilize
          the cells and the buffer plus mercaptoethanol will keep the beta-
          galactosidase happy.

5. After the agar cools and solidifies, the plates may be incubated at either
   25 oC or 30 oC.  The blue color develops in a few hours, depending on the
   strength of the inducer.  For a strong inducer such as a multiple STRE
   element linked to lac-Z, the blue color may be seen in 1-2 hours
   at 25 oC.  For a weak inducer such as a single HSE linked to lac-Z, the
   color becomes visible in 6-8 hours at 25 oC.

6.   Colonies may be picked through the top agar even 5 days later.  Just take a  sterile       Pasteur pipette and poke it through the agar into the desired
   colony or patch.  Then use the tip of the Pasteur pipette to streak a fresh
   plate and, despite the permeabilization, the cells will grow up.



* Alternative for LMPagarose:
•	In stead of low melting agarose you can also use normal agarose. This is for 50ml mix, which is sufficient for 3-4 plates.
•	I usually boil 250mg agarose in 25-30ml 0.5M KPi buffer until it is properly dissolved. Then add unheated KPi upto 46 ml. The temperature should not be more the 55oC. (If you can just hold in your hand it is OK)
•	Then add:
a.	3ml DMF
b.	0.5ml SDS 10%
c.	0.5ml X-Gal 50mg/ml
d.	25ul  β-mercapto-ethanol
Mix carefully trying to avoid foaming and poor over the yeast plate. Don’t wait too long, because it solidifies quickly.
