## A) Fixation of the material:

The fixation is done at 4˚  C during 2 days. Fixative is not very stable for a long time so make fresh!
Fixative Mix (EAF)  per 100 ml:		50 ml Ethanol abs.
                                                     		  5 ml Acetic Acid
                                                    		10 ml Formaldehyde 37%
                                                    		35 ml Milli Q Water

-	Place plant material in a 50 ml Greiner tube filled with 20 ml EAF.
            Flower buds larger then 5 mm should be cut into two halves to improve the penetration of
            the fixative Mix.
 
-	Pull vacuum for 15 minutes, start very slowly. Release the vacuum also very slowly.

-	Incubate 1 hour at 4 ˚ C in EAF.

-	Repeat vacuum step and incubation step 3 (three) times and leave for 2 days at 4˚C, with the caps on the tubes.

## B) Embedding in Paraplast (paraffine chips):

-	Remove EAF and rinse with DEPC-water (0.1% DEPC; 2 hrs 37˚C; autoclave at 120˚C)
-	Dehydrate 30 minutes 70%   Ethanol, Roomtemperature (RT)
                        30 minutes 96%   Ethanol, RT.
                        30 minutes 100% Ethanol, RT.

-	Incubate 30 minutes in 75%  Ethanol, 25% Xylene, RT.
-	Incubate 30 minutes in 50%  Ethanol, 50% Xylene, RT.
-	Incubate 30 minutes in 25%  Ethanol, 75% Xylene, RT.
-	Incubate 3 (three) times 15 minutes in 100% Xyelen, RT.

-	Penetration of paraffine into the plant material:
add a few chips (about 20 pieces)of paraffine to 20 ml Xylene and leave overnight
at 42 ˚ C.

-	Remove Xylene/paraplast and add molten paraffine (60˚ C),  incubate at 60˚C from now on. Refresh the molten paraffine every hour (five (5) times). Incubate overnight at 60˚C. Leave the tubes open to evaporate traces of Xylene.

-	Refresh the molten paraffine once more and pour the boats. Arrange the tissue into a regular array at least 5 mm apart from each other.

-	Store the paraffine boats at 4˚C.

## C) Sectioning and treatments of the tissue

-	Slides have to be coated with Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) to affix the sections to the slides. The procedure is as follows: put the slides on a plate of 37˚C and drop a solution of 100 µg/ml PLL in 100mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0 onto the slides. Let it dry completely (few hours). Treat everything dust and RNAse free! Store the PLL stock solution (20 x) at 4˚C.

-	Cut the sections (8µm) and strech them on the coated slides in a drop of DEPC-water. Put these slides on a  plate of 37˚C. Suck some water away and let it dry completely. Collect the slides in a staining dish holder and incubate it overnight at 37˚C.

-	Deparaffine the sections in Xylene (fresh), 50 (fifty) times up and down in 100% Xylene, be sure that all the paraffine is gone.

-	Hydrate the tissue gradually in steps from 100% Ethanol, 96% Ethanol, 70% Ethanol to DEPC-water.

-	Rinse in DEPC-water, rinse in 0.05 M Tris-HCL pH 7.6 (diluted with DEPC-water).

-	The tissue is treated with proteinase K (1 µg/ml Proteinase K{=10µl protK of 10mg/ml in 100ml Tris} in 0.05 M Tris-HCL pH 7.6) to allow a better probe penetration. Incubate 20 minutes 37˚C. This is the best incubation time for Petunia floral tissue. Shorter incubation time results in a weaker signal, longer incubation time tends to destroy the morphology of the tissue.

-	Remove the Proteinase K solution and incubate 2 (two) times 10 minutes in cold DEPC-water.

-	Rinse once in DEPC-water of RT. Perform the Acetylation Reaction by incubation in 0.25% Acetic Anhydride in 85 mM TEA Buffer pH 8.0 for 10 minutes at RT. 
Per 250ml = 3.17gTEA(triethanol amine); 0.6ml HCl; 625µl acetic anhydride.

-	Rinse 3 (three) times with DEPC-water, RT.

-	Dehydrate gradually from  70% Ethanol to 96% to 100% Ethanol.

-	Rinse once again in fresh 100% Ethanol.

-	Dry it completely. This will take at least 45 minutes.


	









## D) Synthesis of digoxigenin labeled RNA

Digoxigenin labeled RNA was synthesized according to the Boehringer protocol.
(DIG RNA labeling kit)

-	Clone the insert in a vector(pGemTeasy, pGEM3, pBS) with T7, T3 or SP6 promoters on the borders of the insert.
T7 promoters are favorite, so try to get a construct with this promoter on the right side.
Perform a PCR with M13 primers in 50µl. Check on gel for amount of DNA.
Purify PCR product on spin column; perform a phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitate DNA with some Rnase free glycogen added. Wash with 70% ethanol

-	Dissolve in DEPC treated water to a conc. of 75-100ng/µl.   
 
- Add:   
    •	2 µl PCR product(± 100-200ng)   
    •	4 µl Transcription buffer 5x (prewarm at 37˚C)   
    •	2 µl DIG-RNA labeling mix 10x (D202)   
    •	2 µl DTT (100mM)   
    •	2 µl T7, T3 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega)   
    •	1 µl Rnase inhibitor (Rnasin or RnaseOUT)   

-	Incubate 2 hours at 37˚C,
-	Add 1 µl Rnase-free Dnase I and continue the incubation for 10-15 minutes
-	Precipitate with ethanol. Fenol extraction will reduce the yield!
-	Dissolve the large pellet in 100 µl DEPC-water and check 5 µl on a agarose gel. Estimate the amount of RNA synthesized. Incorporation can be checked by spotting several dilutions of the probe on a Hybond nylon filter. Spot the same dilutions of the control DIG-RNA supplied in the kit and perform the immunological detection described below G).
-	The size of the probe must be reduced to 100-150 nt to allow a better penetration  into the tissue. For this the RNA is chemically degraded by incubation in alkali at 60˚C. The length of time for incubation is determined by the formula below:

           t=(Lo-Lf)/(K x Lo x Lf) in minutes
           Lo=starting length (kb)
           Lf=final length (kb) best results were obtained when Lf=0.15 K=0.11
	(2.2kb=56min.; 1kb=51 min.; 0.6kb=45min.)

-	Add to 100µl  probe: 20 µg tRNA and 100 µl hydrolysis buffer.

    •	Hydrolysis buffer: mix 0.2 M NaHCO3  and 0.2 M Na2CO3 in a ratio 2:3. The pH should be 10.2

-	After incubation at 60¸˚C add 1/10 vol 3M NaAc ph 5.5 and 10 µl 10% acetic acid and precipitate with ethanol (-20˚C).

-	Wash pellet with 70% ethanol and dry pellet.

-	Dissolve pellet in 20µl water and store in the freezer. Use 2-4µl of this probe per 1ml hybridization mix. High probe concentrations can give high background.


## E) Hybridization:


Take the DIG labeled probe from the –80˚C freezer and make the right dilution in hybridization mix (300-600 ng/ml. 
Tijs stores DIG RNA probes in water in -20˚C  freezer and adds 2-4µl/ml hybridization mix. Prewarm the mix to 70˚C for one minute before applying to the slides. Use approximately 200µl per section. Cover the slides with a coverslip (without airbubbles) and place them upside down into a staining dish, which is positioned vertically in a humidified box. We use a 2 liter beakerglass with two layers of paper towels soaked with 50% Formamide/2 x SSC on the bottom of the beaker. Close the beaker first with Parafilm and then with aluminium foil. Hybridize overnight at 45˚C.


-  ### Hybridization Mix:   
   •	300 – 600 ng/ml hydrolized probe (see protocol DIG –labeled RNA)   
   •	50% Formamide   
   •	300 mM NaCl   
   •	10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5   
   •	1mM EDTA   
   •	1x Denhardts   
   •	1x Denhardts    
   •	10mM DTT   
   •	250 ng/ml tRNA   
   •	100 µg/ml Poly (r)A   
    
## F) Washing

-	After hybridization put the slides with coverslips in a staining dish with 2 x SSC at RT (15 min). The coverslips should slide off the slides and fall to the bottom of the staining dish.

-	Washing procedure: Use one of the below, dependent of the probe used!
      1)	Mild wash: 3 x 25 min. with 1 x SSC  at 37˚C.
      2)	Stringent wash: 3 x 25 min. with 0.2 x SSC at 55˚C. preheated bottle in the waterbath

-	RNAse treatment: incubate 30 min. at 37˚C in prewarmed NTE (500mM NaCl / TE pH 8.0)with 20 µg/ml RNAse A (Boehringer).  Use a stock solution of 10 mg/ml and store at -20˚C in storage buffer(=.10mM Tris/HCl pH7.0; 5mM CaCl2; 50% glycerol)
-	Rinse a few times in MQ-water(Don’t wait long!).

-	Incubation Antibodies: Anti-DIG Anti-body in Buffer 2 (1: 1000).
Drop 200 µl on a slide and cover with a coverslip. Incubate in a humidified immuno slide staining tray for 2 hours at RT.

-	Wash 3 (three) times 20 minutes with Buffer 2B(100 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5 / 150 mM NaCl), shake carefully at RT.

-	Wash 10 minutes in Buffer 3, shake carefully at RT

    •	Buffer 3: 100 mM Tris-HCL ph 9.5
                100 mm NaCl 
                  50 mM MgCl2 

-	Enzymincubation / Colourreaction; O/N in a humidified immuno slide staining tray, in the dark at RT.
Add to 10 ml Buffer 3 45 µl NBT-solution (eppendorf tube number 4 from Boehringer KIT) and 35 µl  X-Phospate-solution (eppendorf tube number 5). Drop about 0.5 ml colouring solution on a slide, cover with a coverslip and incubate O/N. (Sometimes a longer incubation time is necessary depending on the probe concentration and expression level.)
