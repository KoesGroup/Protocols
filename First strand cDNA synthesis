First strand cDNA synthesis

Most items are stored in the box 1st strand cDNA stuff in P553

For each synthesis:

-	Take 2.5g RNA in a volume of 1.15l sterile water in a 1.5ml tube
-	Put in boiling water for 1 minute and cool on ice immediately

Make a mix of the following components (keep on ice):
For each sample: (for more samples make 1 mix for all)

-	10l 5x RT buffer
-	20l dNTPs 2mM each (dATP/dCTP/dGTP/dTTP) careful: the vials of this concentration are stored in the box 1st strand cDNA stuff and of a different concentration than the PCR dNTPs
-	3l oligo dT race primer 10M (oligo nr 009)
-	0.5l M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (200U/l)

-	Add 38.5l of this mix to the RNA vial, mix spin down and incubate 1 hour at 42C


-	Add 200l sterile water to each vial and mix well. 

Take 10l for a PCR reaction of 50l

5X First-Strand Buffer: 
250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at room temperature), 
375 mM KCl,
15 mM MgCl2
