## PREPARATION OF PETAL PROTOPLASTS FOR DCFDA STAINING.

### BUFFERS FOR PETAL PROTOPLASTS:

#### TEX BUFFER (0.5 L)


Solution A
```
1.55 g Gamborg’s B5 salts (SIGMA) 
250 mg MES
375 mg CaCl2*2H2O
125 mg NH4NO3
    Dissolve all these salts in 100 mL ddH2O，pH 5,7 (with 1M KOH)，Filter sterilise (0,45 µm pore)
```
Solution B
```
68.45 g sucrose，dissolve this amount sucrose in 400 mL, autoclave.
```
___Mix solution A (100 mL) and B (400 mL) well, to get the Tex buffer.___

#### W5 osmoticum	1l 
```
9 g    NaCl (154 mM)
18.3 g CaCl2*2H2O (125 mM)
0.37 g KCl (5 mM)
1 g    Glucose (5 mM)       (adjust to pH 5,7)
```

#### 10X LEAF DIGESTION SOLUTION (stock, stored at -20°C)
```
2% w/v macrozyme R-10
4% w/v cellulase R-10
in TEX BUFFER
	Mix for at least 30 minutes, then centrifuge at 4000 rpm (in a 50 ml centrifuge tube) for 15 minutes to remove 
	insoluble particles. Filter sterilize the supernatant using a syringe filter (0,45 µm pore) and store in 5 ml 
	aliquots at -20°C. Dilute to a total volume of 50 ml with TEX buffer before use.
```

#### DCFDA	10 µM
```		
Prepare stock 10 µL aliquots of 1000 µM DCFA in DMSO. 
Remove air in the tubes with nitrogen (using a hose pointed
to the tubes (but do not blow the solution into the air!). 
Keep the dry stock in nitrogen too by placing the vial in a beaker and filling the beaker with nitrogen (do not blow 
the vial directly or the powder will be blown away
Store at -20 C
Always keep this solution in the dark.
```



### FIRST DAY.

1.	Collect petals from plants grown in greenhouse. Choose young flowers completely opened the same day or the day after. (In my opinion, the best plants for getting protoplast are M1xV30).

2.	You have to perform all next steps under the flow hood!!! (TEX BUFFER can be easily contaminated and, in this unhappy fate, you’ll be forced to say “bye-bye” to your dead cells”!!!

3.	Sterilize petals by dipping in 70% ethanol for 1 secon (optional) and after that by immersion in 5% hypochlorite solution (a 5 fold dilution of commercial bleach showed to be equivalent) for 30 seconds followed by rinsing 3 times in sterile water (it is comfortable to dip the petals sequentially in 2 sterile beakers containing no less than 200ml sterile H2O.

4.	Put the sterilized petal on a sterile Petri dish and cut in two halves.

5.	Transfer the two halves of the flower to a Petri dish containing 2 ml of DIGESTION SOLUTION MIX (1X).

6.	Fill the empty place on the Petri dish with petals processed in the same way.

7.	Now you are ready for cutting!!!

8.	Cut petals gently using a needle bed (Kenzan) or a scalpel. You should hold the petal in place with a pair of forceps without damage the tissue. (ask for demonstration prior to starting!!!). Damaging will start “wounding stress” signalling that can, at the extreme, result in no surviving cells 24 hours later. Use a sharp blade; do not induce “wounding”.

9.	Add 8 ml of DIGESTION SOLUTION MIX (1X) to cut material and close the Petri dish with parafilm.

10.	Incubate the plates in the dark (you can cover the plates with aluminium foil) overnight at 26°C or room temperature on your bench. (Keeping the plates in “baby-room” is also ok!)


### SECOND DAY.

1. Gently shake the plates in the dark up to 30 minutes (no more).

2. Carefully, swing the tissue around the buffer to promote the exit of the protoplasts 

3. With a red-burning scapel, make a "V shape" cut in the petri dish

4. Decant the cells into a 50mL Falcon keeping the widest angle possible and avoiding tissue debris to flow through. Add TEX until 25 mL

5. Centrifuge tubes and spin for 10 minutes at 700 (RPM) or 100g (RCF) at room temperature into a swing-out rotor, with acceleration 2 and deceleration 0. Living protoplasts will float whereas cell debris will be pelleted.

6.	Using a long (230 mm) Pasteur pipette (remember to sterilize it with Bunsen!!!) connected to a persistaltic pump, create a “window” in the centre of the floating protoplasts layer by pushing the cells outwards from the centre (a demonstration is useful before you try this). As soon as the pipette passes through the protoplasts layer, increase the suction on the pump and suck up the pellet of debris and as much medium as possible. 
Remember to slow the pump rate well before the floating cells reach the bottom of the tube, or your yield will be very low!!!

6.5 Add 25 mL TEX, centrifudge again and remove solution

7. Add 1 mL of TEX buffer

8. Split the protoplasts into 2 12 mL Falcon tubes (500 uL each)

9. Add 500 uL of TEX 20 uM DCFDA (10 uL DCFDA 1000 uM in 490 uL TEX) or just TEX (for the mock)

10. Incubate for 30 minutes in the dark

11.	Add 9 mL of W5 buffer and shake gently

12.	Remove SN

13. Resuspend in 2 mL of TEX buffer


### THIRD DAY.

If your protoplast are still alive...CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Now you are ready for confocal microscopy, protein extraction, RNA extraction...and whatever you like!!!

___GOOD LUCK!!!___
