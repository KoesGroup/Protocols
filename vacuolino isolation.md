## Workflow:
---

1.	Isolate protoplasts as described by Mariana Faraco.

o	Except:	Peel the flower with tweezer (like Shuangjiang). Fill 5 Petri dishes (~16 flowers) as starting amount.  

o	Except: wash protoplast in electroporation buffer instead of TEX. 

o	Wash at least 3 times if possible * till there is no pellet*. 

2.	Resuspend the protoplast in 10.5 ml prewarmed lysis buffer (42 degrees) 

i.	Take 10ml “balloon pipet” and go 6-8 times up and down * carefully*

ii.	After mixing, wait 2 minutes

iii. 	_check lysed protoplasts under microscope_

3.	Divide the lysed protoplast in 2 x 15ml tubes (red lid). (approximately 6 mL per tube)

4.	Over-layer the solution with 3 mL 2% Ficoll solution (RT)

i.	Take a glass Pasteur-pipet with balloon and put just the tip in the layer underneath.

ii.	Layer it carefully but not too slow….the layers should not mix.

5.	Over-layer the 2% Ficoll solution with 1% ficoll solution

i.	Over-layering is executed the same as before.

5.	Over-layer the 1% Ficoll solution with 0% ficoll solution *ICE COLD*

i.	Over-layering is executed the same as before.

6.	Spin the tubes for 90 min at 3500 rpm (Centrifuge used for protoplasts)

7.	The vacuoles are between the 1% ficoll layer and the 0% Ficoll layer

8. 	To collect the layer vacuolino’s, first remove 1 ml of the 0% layer by pipetting carefully!!!

9.	then pipet the layer, take approximately 1 mL, and put it in an appendorf tube. 

i. 	Ask demonstration 

10.	spin down at full speed in the table top centrifuge (14600 x G)

11.	Now carefully remove 900uL without disturbing the lower 100uL (this is were the vacuolino reside)

12.	Now you have 100uL containing vacuolino, check them under the microscope!
