# Leaf disc DNA-isolation


#### Start with safelock cap tubes taking samples!

## Method 
1.	Take one eppendorf-tube size disc from a leaf and grind with a pestle until the leaf disc has become slurry. You can do 12 samples in 1 go.
2.	Add 600µl extraction buffer (see below) by rinsing/washing the pestle. Shake well.
3.	Leave at room temp till all (or half) samples have been ground. 
4.	Incubate at 65ºC for 5-10 minutes.
5.	Add 350µl phenol/chloroform and shake well. Take care that tubes remain closed. (Gloves, fume hood)
6.	Spin 10 minutes and transfer 450-500µl supernatant to clean tube containing 400µl isopropanol.
7.	 Shake, keep at roomtemp for 5 min. Spin 10 min full speed. 
8.	Pour off  supernatant and wash pellet with 250µl 70 % EtOH. 
9.	Resuspend the DNA in 200µl TE(10/0.1) containing 1 ul/sample Rnase(10mg/ml).
10.	Shake well and incubate 15-20 minutes at 65ºC to degrade RNA.
11.	Check 5µl DNA on agarose gel.
12.	In general 5µl will be sufficient for a PCR of 25µl
13.	If PCRs don’t work try with less DNA and more cycles(35 or 40).

DNA extraction buffer = 0.1M Tris pH 8.0;  0.5M NaCl;  50mM EDTA; 10mM  mercapto-ethanol(=700l/liter)
TE    = 0.01 M Tris pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA
EDTA = 0.5M pH 8.0
TRIS = 1.0 M pH 8.0
