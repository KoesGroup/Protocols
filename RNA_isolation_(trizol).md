# Total RNA isolation protocol with TRIZOL, including small RNA’s. 
(Personal adaption Kees Spelt)

1.	Prepare as many 2.0 ml vials as samples with 1.5ml Trizol
2.	Grind equal amount of flowerbuds of each stage (2 flower corollas in case of mature buds) with mortar and pestle in liquid N2 to a fine powder. Don’t let thaw!
3.	Add powder with pre cooled spatula to the 1.5ml Trizol(powder maximum to the 2.0ml mark on the tube) and shake until it is mixed well and no more solid. Do this for all samples and collect. Incubate samples for 5 minutes at 25-30&deg;C. 
4.	Add 0.3 ml chloroform; shake vigorously by hand for 15 seconds
5.	Incubate at 25-30C for 2-3 minutes.
6.	Shake again and spin samples at no more than 12.000 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature or 2-8&deg;C.
7.	Transfer aqueous phase to new tube (leave some of the aqueous phase on top of the interphase to avoid DNA contamination)
8.	Add 1 volume of propanol-2. 
9.	Shake well and leave at room temperature for 10 minutes.
10.	Spin samples at no more than 12.000 x g for 10 minutes room temperature.
11.	Remove supernatant carefully. 
12.	Wash the RNA pellet well with 1.5ml of 70% ethanol to remove traces of Trizol by inverting every now and then or shaking mildly for 15-30 minutes(or overnight in the fridge) to give the Trizol traces give time to diffuse from the pellet. Spin 1 minute and remove 70% ethanol carefully
13.	DNase treatment :dissolve pellet in 447µl RNase free water in shaker. Add 50µl of 10x DNase buffer and 3µl RNase free Dnase(Roche). Incubate for 30 min. at 37&deg;C.
14.	Add 500µl of phenol/chloroform, shake well and spin 10 minutes.
15.	Transfer aqueous phase to new tube; add 1/10 volume of RNase free 3M NaAc and 1 volume of propanol-2. 
16.	Shake well and leave at room temperature for 10 minutes.
17.	Spin samples for 10 minutes.
18.	Remove supernatant well. Wash with 500µl of 70% ethanol. Leave at RT to let phenol diffuse or shake in shaker.
19.	 Spin a few minutes and remove supernatant well.
20.	Dissolve RNA in appropriate amount (usually 50-200µl, depend on size of the pellet) RNase free water (15-30 min. shaker).
21.	Measure concentration with Nanodrop. It is very advisable to check RNA amount on agarose gel, because traces of phenol influence the absorbance heavily. In case of phenol contamination it is advisable to do another precipitation step.
