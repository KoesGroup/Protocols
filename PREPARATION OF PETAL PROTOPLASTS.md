## PREPARATION OF PETAL PROTOPLASTS.


### Before starting:

1. You need a lot of plasmid DNA to get protoplast transformed. This DNA must be:

* PURE (without salt contamination)
* CONCENTRTATED (2 µg/µl)
* SUPERCOILED

	We use MIDI KIT from QIAGEN to get this kind of product. 
	In order to do not lose supercoiled structure, don’t use vortex and avoid to freeze and defreeze your sample!!! Protoplasts 		require supercoiled DNA to get transformed!!!


2. Be careful with PEG solution: it is one of the most common cause of “unworking experiment”.
Adjust the pH and wait some minutes. It can happen that pH drops and you have to adjust it again!!!
AFTER this add PEG and wait for its thawing in solution. PEG damages the pH meter electrode so you cannot adjust later. 
Finally split solution in more aliquots and autoclave. After autoclaving, close well the tube plug and store at 37°C.

Read the protocol before starting and make sure you have all the stock solutions ready.


FIRST DAY.

1.	Collect petals from plants grown in greenhouse. Choose young flowers completely opened the same day or the day after. (In my opinion, the best plants for getting protoplast are M1xV30).

2.	You have to perform all next steps under the flow hood!!! (TEX BUFFER can be easily contaminated and, in this unhappy fate, you’ll be forced to say “bye-bye” to your dead cells”!!!

3.	Sterilize petals by dipping in 70% ethanol for 1 secon (optional) and after that by immersion in 5% hypochlorite solution (a 5 fold dilution of commercial bleach showed to be equivalent) for 30 seconds followed by rinsing 3 times in sterile water (it is comfortable to dip the petals sequentially in 2 sterile beakers containing no less than 200ml sterile H2O.

4.	Put the sterilized petal on a sterile Petri dish and cut in two halves.

5.	Transfer the two halves of the flower to a Petri dish containing 2 ml of DIGESTION SOLUTION MIX (1X).

6.	Fill the empty place on the Petri dish with petals processed in the same way.

7.	Now you are ready for cutting!!!

8.	Cut petals gently using a needle bed (Kenzan) or a scalpel. You should hold the petal in place with a pair of forceps without damage the tissue. (ask for demonstration prior to starting!!!). Damaging will start “wounding stress” signalling that can, at the extreme, result in no surviving cells 24 hours later. Use a sharp blade; do not induce “wounding”.

9.	Add 8 ml of DIGESTION SOLUTION MIX (1X) to cut material and close the Petri dish with parafilm.

10.	Incubate the plates in the dark (you can cover the plates with aluminium foil) overnight at 26°C or room temperature on your bench. (Keeping the plates in “baby-room” is also ok!)



 

SECOND DAY.

1.	Gently shake the plates in the dark up to 30 minutes (no more).

2.	Now you are ready for protoplast isolation. 

3.	Hold the 100 µm nylon or steel mesh (previously sterilized by Bunsen or autoclave) on a sterile Petri dish.

4.	Wash the 100 µm mesh with TEX buffer to promote the passage of liquid through the mesh.

5.	Gently shake the plates again by hands, this time slowly pouring the resulting digestion mix into the filter (with the Petri dish underneath!!!). In order to keep more care of your “naked cells”, you can use a cut sterile plastic pipette (diameter 3-5mm) to take the digestion mix and to put it on the filter. 
Remember that protoplasts are like “'soap bubbles”, you have to treat them with extreme care!

6.	Use a little TEX buffer to wash the plates immediately after removing the digestion mix: this allows you to collect any protoplasts that are stuck to the Petri dish. The same TEX buffer can be used to wash all plates.

7.	When all plates are empty, gently drip a little TEX buffer onto the filter to release further protoplasts from the petals debris, this also provides the first step in the adaptation to the new buffer.


8.	Decant (or use a plastic pipette with the cut tip, diameter 3-5mm) the protoplast suspension into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and spin for 10 minutes at 700 (RPM) or 100g (RCF) at room temperature into a swing-out rotor, with acceleration 2 and deceleration 0. Living protoplasts will float whereas cell debris will be pelleted.

9.	Using a long (230 mm) Pasteur pipette (remember to sterilize it with Bunsen!!!) connected to a persistaltic pump, create a “window” in the centre of the floating protoplasts layer by pushing the cells outwards from the centre (a demonstration is useful before you try this). As soon as the pipette passes through the protoplasts layer, increase the suction on the pump and suck up the pellet of debris and as much medium as possible. 
Remember to slow the pump rate well before the floating cells reach the bottom of the tube, or your yield will be very low!!!

10.	Increase the volume of the protoplast suspension to 25 ml with TEX buffer (Make sure stock bottle and tubes do not touch each other or the stock TEX buffer may soon become contaminated).

11.	Spin again at 700 (RPM) for 10 minutes with acceleration 2 and deceleration 0.


12.	Remove the underlying solution and pellet as before and repeat washing 1 more times (or, in case of low yield or troubles, until the pellet is minimal)
13.	Incubate your protoplasts with ice bath for 30 mins. 

14.	During those 30 minutes, arrange under the flow everything you need for transformation. (TEX BUFFER, MMM SOLUTION, PEG SOLUTION, pipette, tips...and DNA already quantified of course!!!)

15.	After incubation time, you start again.

16.	Take off tube from the fridge and spin again at 700 (RPM) for 5 minutes with acceleration 2 and deceleration 0.


17.	Remove the underlying solution and pellet as before.

18.	Resuspend the protoplasts in an appropriate volume of MMM SOLUTION. You need 300 µl of protoplast for each transformation. So your appropriate volume of MMM will be: 

(number of transformation x 300 µl). 

For example if you have to perform 6 transformations: 
(6 x 300 µl) = 1,8 ml
You’ll add 1,8 ml of MMM solution to protoplasts.

Avoid keeping protoplasts too much longer in this solution: according to some researchers, protoplasts don’t like MMM solution!!!

19.	Now you are ready to transform!!!

20.	Put 20µg of plasmid DNA in the bottom of a 12 ml STERILE tube. 
This amount is optimal for small plasmids (4 Kb), increase it proportionally for larger plasmids (e.g.: 30-50 µg for 8 Kb plasmids). Problems start using more than 80 µg since the large quantity of DNA induce cells “agglutinating”. 

21.	Add 300 µl of protoplast resuspended in MMM SOLUTION.

22.	Add 300 µl of PEG SOLUTION and gently shake.

23.	Wait 1 minute (no more!).

24.	Add 2 ml of TEX BUFFER.

25.	Incubate tubes for 1 hours at 26°C. Don’t exceed two hours:  treatment with Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) can fuse protoplasts!!! 

26.	At this time the protocol may be interrupted for a coffee break...

27.	Recover tubes and bring them under the flow.

28.	Add 5 ml (or more) of TEX buffer or W5 BUFFER to each tubes, gently shake (ask for demonstration!!!) W5 is easier because the protoplasts are in the pellet, while in the other buffers they will float on top.

29.	Spin at 700 (RPM) for 5 minutes with acceleration 2 and deceleration 0.

30.	Remove the underlying (TEX).or supernatant (W5) solution and pellet as before.

31.	Resuspend the protoplasts in 2 ml of TEX BUFFER.

32.	Incubate tubes in the dark at 26°C overnight.

THIRD DAY.

If your protoplast are still alive...CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Now you are ready for confocal microscopy, protein extraction, RNA extraction...and whatever you like!!!

GOOD LUCK!!!
