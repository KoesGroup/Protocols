## Gateway cloning by BP and LR recombination

### BP Reaction 

1. Add the following components to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube at room temperature and mix: 
- attB1+attB2 PCR fragment (75 ng) 1-3 μl. For purification of the PCR fragment see* below
- Donor vector (75 ng/μl) 1 μl 
- TE buffer, pH 8.0 to 4 μl 
2. To each sample (Step 1, above), add 1 μl of BP Clonase™ enzyme mix to the reaction and mix well by vortexing briefly twice. Microcentrifuge briefly. 
3. Incubate reactions at 25°C for 1 hour. 
4. Add 4.5 μl sterile water and 1 μl of the Proteinase K solution to each sample to terminate the reaction. Vortex briefly. Incubate samples at 37°C for 10 minutes. 

### Transformation 
1.	Transform 5 μl of each BP reaction into 50 μl of electrocompetent cells(XL-1; Jm109, DB10B). Add 1ml of S.O.C. Medium and incubate at 37°C for 45-60 minutes. 
2.	Spin 10sec. remove most of the liquid, resuspend and plate on the appropriate antibiotic LB/YT plate

Incubate overnight at 37C.

*Purification of PCR fragment for BP reaction:
You may use attB-PCR products in the BP reaction without purification. 
To achieve a higher percentage of desired clones, use PEG/MgCl2 precipitation to remove primer-dimers or small DNA molecules (<300 bp). 
30% PEG 8000/30 mM MgCl2 Solution is provided to purify PCR products
away from other DNA <300 bp in size, including primer-dimers. 
Run a 25 μl PCR reaction, dilute the PCR reaction 4-fold with TE [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5-8), 1 mM EDTA], 
Add 1/2 volume of 30% PEG 8000/30 mM MgCl2 of the total volume.
Solution (final concentrations of 10% PEG, 10 mM MgCl2), and vortex.
Centrifuge 15 minutes at full speed in a microcentrifuge. Carefully remove
Supernatant. Washing the pellet with 70% ethanol is possible but not always required. Depends on your taste…
Resuspend the pellet in TE to >10 ng/μl. Check on gel to be sure the Nanodrop measurements are correct.

Important: Use the recommended proportion of PEG/MgCl2 to ensure that
correct-sized products are removed.
 
### LR Reaction 

1. Add the following components to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube at room temperature and mix: 
Entry clone (75 ng) 1-3 μl 
Destination vector (75 ng/μl) 1 μl 
TE buffer, pH 8.0 upto 4 μl 
2. To each sample (Step 1, above), add 1 μl of LR Clonase™ enzyme mix to the reaction and mix well by vortexing briefly twice. Microcentrifuge briefly. 
3. Incubate reactions at 25°C for 1 hour. 
4. Add 4.5 μl sterile water and 1 μl of the Proteinase K solution to each sample to terminate the reaction. Vortex briefly. Incubate samples at 37°C for 10 minutes. 

### Transformation 
1.	Transform 5 μl of each LR reaction into 50 μl of electrocompetent cells. Add 700 μl of S.O.C. Medium and incubate at 37°C for 45-60 minutes. 
2.	Spin briefly and remove most of liquid. Leave app. 100ul vortex well to resupend. Plate 1 drop and leftover of each transformation onto selective plates. Depending on the antibiotic marker of the vector.

Incubate overnight at 37C.
