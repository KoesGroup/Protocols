-	5% Ficoll solution (for one protoplast isolation)
o	4 mL Lysis buffer + 4 mL Vacuolar buffer

Workflow:
1.	Isolate protoplasts as described by Mariana Faraco.
o	Except: wash protoplast in electroporation buffer instead of TEX. 
o	Wash at least 3 times if possible  till there is no pellet. 

2.	Resuspend the protoplast in 10.5 ml prewarmed lysis buffer (42 degrees) 

i.	Take 10ml “balloon pipet” and go 6-8 times up and down  carefully!
ii.	After mixing, wait 2 minutes

3.	Divide the lysed protoplast in 2 x 15ml tubes (red lid). (approximately 6 mL per tube)

4.	Over-layer the solution with 4 mL 5% Ficoll solution (RT)

i.	Take a glass Pasteur-pipet with balloon and put just the tip in the layer underneath.
ii.	Layer it carefully but not too slow….the layers should not mix.

5.	Over-layer the 5% Ficoll solution with 1.5ml Vacuolar buffer (ICE COLD)

i.	Over-layering is executed the same as before.

6.	Spin the tubes for 50 min at 3500 rpm (Centrifuge used for protoplasts)

7.	The vacuoles are between the 5% ficoll layer and the vacuolar buffer
