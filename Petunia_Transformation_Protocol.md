PETUNIA TRANSFORMATION PROTOCOL 

Prepare for each transformation: 
1 day before
-	1 liter sterile water
-	3-4 petridishes with MS medium + hormones+ acetosyringone; without antibiotics for co-cultivation.  MS medium: see below.
-	6-10 petridishes with MS medium + hormones; with antibiotics for selection.
-	A.tum culture with construct to grow overnight
-	
Transformation day:
-	70% ethanol
-	0.5% hypochlorite (usually 1:8 dilution of commercial bleech, which is 4% hypochlorite)
-	forceps/scalpels/spatulas
-	6 sterile vials (monster/opbergdoos)
-	sterile petridishes for cutting sterile plant tissue
-	petunia leaves
-	Fresh 1:10 diluted (in water) of overnight grown Agrobacterium tumefaciens culture + 20ÂµM acetosyringone (stock= 200mM in DMSO, so dilute 1:10.000) added just before transformation. This culture preferable grown with only selective antibiotic for the plasmid, so without rifampicin. Rifampicin sometimes causes aggregates of Agrobacterium, giving strange results (we think).

Leaf explants can be taken either from in vitro cultivated plants or from plants growing in the greenhouse. Many inbred lines, like R27 and derived lines, are very hard to transform. We are sometimes successful, using in vitro cultivated plants as starting material. For in vitro cultivation use 0.5x MS medium without hormones. 

For easy transformable lines (W115, V26, VR) we take leaves of young plants from the greenhouse.  R27 or W138 lines are nearly impossible to transform.
Surface sterilization is done by just dipping the leaves in 70% ethanol. (This step is optional and can give more necrosis especially when you use very young leaves. In that case skip the ethanol dipping step).
Incubate leaves for 10 minutes in 0.5% hypochlorite (usually 1:8 dilution of commercial bleech, which is 4% hypochlorite) followed by 5 rinses in sterile water within a period of 10 minutes. For cutting explants, try to avoid taking leaves showing dark spots. This is usually a sign of necrosis. If it happens, try smaller amounts of leaves and no 70% ethanol treatment.

Cut the leaves into explants of maximum 0.5x0.5 cm. All sides of the explants should be wounded. Use a sharp scalpel (renew frequently) and cut in a sterile petridish. To make this cutting process more efficient, put similar sized leaves into a stack when cutting. For 1 transformation we use 10-15 leaves, depending on the size, giving 60-90 explants.

Add the explants to a petridish with 20-25 ml of a 1:10 diluted (in water + 20uM acetosyringone) of overnight grown Agrobacterium tumefaciens culture (LBA 4404/EHA 105/AGL 0), so that all explants are floating. Incubate 10-15 minutes to attach the bacteria to the explants.
Transfer explants sterile to MS plates without antibiotics, 20-30 explants per plate.

Co-cultivate for 2-3 days at 25oC under day-night regime.
In the co-cultivation medium 20uM acetosyringone can be added (stock: 200mM in DMSO). This gives much better results than without.

Transfer explants to plates (8-10 per plate) to selective medium plates which is the same medium supplemented with 250 mg/l carbenicillin  to kill the bacteria and 250 mg/l kanamycin  25 mg/l hygromycin or 5 mg/l basta for selection(depending on the vector).
Take care that the edges of the explants touch the medium, otherwise you get a lot of escapes. Grow under similar conditions as above.

Check the plates every day or 2 days in the first weeks for fungi. Usually you can save quite a lot of explants when you see an incidental appearing fungus growing.
In case of necrosis (yellow or brown explants) remove the explants. Polyphenolic compounds will kill all explants.

Transfer the explants after 3 weeks to fresh selection plates. After 3-6 weeks shoots should appear. If no shoots appear but a lot of callus, it may help to transfer them to plates with less or without NAA and BAP but double amount 2mg/l Zeatin. 


Rooting:
Excise shoots and root them on hormone free medium supplemented with folic acid, 
250 mg/l carbenicillin and 50 mg/l kanamycin, 5 mg/l hygromycin or 1 mg/l basta mg/l. Roots should appear after 1-2 weeks. Size of the shoots for excision is a matter of taste. I prefer rather big shoots (leaves touching the lid of the petridish), other prefer shoots of a few mm.

After decent rooting, wash away the agar carefully from the roots, put in jiffy or soil and grow plants in a place in the greenhouse with high (for the first days only) to acclimatize and to form more roots (usually 2-3 weeks).

MS medium is per 0.5 liter:
- 10 g sucrose
- 5 g glucose
- 2.2 g MS-macro and micro elements with Gamborg B5 vitamines (we use Duchefa cat.nr. M 0231)
- 4 g Micro Agar(0.8%)
- 0.5 ml folic acid(1mg/ml) Duchefa cat.nr. F 0608.
- 0.5 ml 6-BAP(2mg/ml) Duchefa cat.nr. B 0904(Dissolve 10x stock in 1M NaOH)
- 0.5 ml NAA(0.1 mg/ml) Duchefa cat.nr. N 0903(Dissolve 10x stock in 1M NaOH)
- 0.5 ml zeatin(1 mg/ml); optional for petunia Duchefa cat.nr. Z 0917(Dissolve 10x stock in 1M NaOH)


Adjust to pH 5.7-5.9, autoclave at 110 oC for 10 minutes. All these hormones and vitamins are co-autoclavable. So plates must be poured the same day. 
Hormones are present during co-cultivation as well as during selection, but not during rooting. Only folic acid is present.

For antibiotics in selective medium, MS is supplemented with 250 mg/l carbenicillin (or cefotaxim) to kill the bacteria and 250 mg/l kanamycin, 25 mg/l hygromycin or 5 mg/l basta for selection(depending on the vector).

* Agar seems trickier because there are many brands and qualities. Some people have problems with Oxoid agar. We use Micro agar from Duchefa cat.nr. M 1002


Good luck!
