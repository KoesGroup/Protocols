# First strand cDNA synthesis

Most items are stored in the box 1st strand cDNA stuff in P553

For each synthesis:

-	Take 2.5ug RNA in a volume of 16.5ul sterile water in a 1.5ml tube
-	Put in boiling water for 1 minute and cool on ice immediately

Make a mix of the following components (keep on ice):
For each sample: (for more samples make 1 mix for all)

-	10ul 5x RT buffer
-	20ul dNTPs 2mM each (dATP/dCTP/dGTP/dTTP) careful: the vials of this concentration are stored in the box 1st strand cDNA stuff and of a different concentration than the PCR dNTPs
-	3ul oligo dT race primer 10ÔÅ≠M (oligo nr 009)
-	0.5ul M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (200U/ul)

-	Add 33.5ul of this mix to the RNA vial, mix spin down and incubate 1 hour at 42 centigrades


-	Add 200ul sterile water to each vial and mix well. 

Take 10ul for a PCR reaction of 50ul

5X First-Strand Buffer: 
250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at room temperature), 
375 mM KCl,
15 mM MgCl2
